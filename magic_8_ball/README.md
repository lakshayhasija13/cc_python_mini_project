# Magic 8-Ball

A Magic 8-Ball simulator that randomly generates answers to yes/no questions.

## Description

This project simulates the classic Magic 8-Ball toy. It takes a user's name and question, generates a random number between 1 and 10, maps it to one of nine possible responses, and prints the result.

## Concepts Used

- Variables (strings and integers)
- `import random` and `random.randint()`
- `if / elif / else` conditionals
- f-strings and `print()` statements

## Sample Output

```
Mohan asks: Will I win the lottery?
Magic 8-Ball's answer: Ask again later
```

## How to Run

```bash
python code.py
```
