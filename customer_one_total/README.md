# Customer One Total

A simple Python script that calculates the total cost for a customer purchasing furniture items, including sales tax.

## Description

This project defines product descriptions and prices for three items (a loveseat, a settee, and a lamp), then builds an itemized receipt for a customer by adding selected items and computing the final total with 8.8% sales tax applied.

## Concepts Used

- Variables (strings and floats)
- Arithmetic operators and augmented assignment (`+=`)
- String concatenation
- `print()` statements

## Sample Output

```
Customer One Items:
